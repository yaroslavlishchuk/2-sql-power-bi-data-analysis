The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve our recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.\n\n**About the company**\n\nIn 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. \n\nUntil now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.\n\n**The goal of this project**\n\nDesign marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to understand: \n* how  do annual members and casual riders differ; \n* why casual riders would buy a membership; \n* how digital media could affect their marketing tactics.\n\n**My Responsibilities**\n\nThe director of marketing has assigned me the question to answer: **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**\n\nI will produce a report with the following deliverables:\n1. A clear statement of the business task\n2. A description of all data sources used\n3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data\n4. A summary of my analysis\n5. Supporting visualizations and key findings\n6.

Emphasize the value proposition of an annual membership for users who enjoy extended rides, showcasing it as a more cost-effective option.\n\n3. **Summer Membership Packages:**\n\nTake advantage of the notable increase in the average duration and number of rides for casual riders from May to September. Launch special summer membership packages tailored to the preferences of casual riders during this period. Emphasize the convenience of having an annual membership for spontaneous and frequent summer rides, positioning it as a hassle-free and economical choice.","metadata":{}}]}
